                        I always felt like I could do anything. That’s the main thing people
                        are controlled by! Thoughts- their perception of themselves! They're
                        slowed down by their perception of themselves. If you're taught you
                        can’t do anything, you won’t do anything. I was taught I could do
                        everything.
